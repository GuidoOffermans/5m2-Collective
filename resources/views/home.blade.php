                5m2 is a collective of creatives in Zurich. Our goal is to connect people with a strong foothold in
                the creative scene with one’s, who don’t. We want to create access to places, infrastructures and
                projects that otherwise stay hidden for some members of the community due to structural injustices.
                The people within this collective shape and move the structure, creating a space to grow and learn
                from shared knowledge and experiences.
